## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. Configure server/db/index.js mongoDB connection
3. $ npm start
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase the use of databases, specifically mySQL. The legacy front end messenger app will pull chat history as well as save new chat messages into my mySQL database. The database includes chat rooms with multiple users.
